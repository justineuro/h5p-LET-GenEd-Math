## h5p-LET-GenEd-Math
[h5p-LET-GenEd-Math](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math) is an implementation of [h5p-standalone](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone).  More information on H5P may be found at [https://h5p.org](https://h5p.org).

The file [`LETReview-GenEd-Math.html`](./LETReview-GenEd-Math.html) (see the H5P rendered [here](https://justineuro.github.io/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math/LETReview-GenEd-Math.html)) contains links to seven (7) H5Ps that use the [Question Set H5P template](https://h5p.org/question-set).

This folder includes (among others):  
  
* [`LETReview-GenEd-Math.html`](./LETReview-GenEd-Math.html) - an HTML file that contains the javascript code for rendering the H5P.
* [`dist`](./dist) - a folder from the [h5p-standalone v.3.8.0](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) distribution that contains the essential files that allow the H5P content to be rendered in a standalone HTML page (i.e., independent of a platform such as certain Learning Management Systems (LMSs)).

----
### Notes:  
1. H5p files may conveniently be viewed by using the [Lumi](https://lumi.education/en/) app.
2. Many H5Ps may be saved as sinlge-page HTML files by using the Lumi softare: open the H5P in the Lumi software then export as HTML; see examples here: [`h5p-LET-GenEd-Math-HTML`](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-LET-GenEd-Math-HTML).
